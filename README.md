## Overview

### The challenge

I found the challenge of implementing hover and focus states for interactive elements to be a great learning experience. It added a nice touch of interactivity to the card.

## My process

### Built with

I used Semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, Flexbox, and CSS Grid to structure and style the card. The decision to use these technologies was based on their suitability for creating a responsive layout.

### What I learned

I enhanced my coding knowledge through consistent practice. One specific example is the use of Google Fonts, where I employed two different fonts to highlight various heading levels and paragraphs.

### Continued development

I aim to further study responsive design from scratch, focusing on optimizing layouts for different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Using different fonts for headings and paragraphs.

## Author

I approached the design by trying to closely replicate the provided image, using Google Fonts to enhance typography.

## Acknowledgments

I completed this project independently without collaboration, drawing inspiration from the provided design.

This project was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and I look forward to creating more designs from scratch in future projects.
